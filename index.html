            <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Hello, I am Milton. I want to be a Web Developer. A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>
